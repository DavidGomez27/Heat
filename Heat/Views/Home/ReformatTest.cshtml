@*//this gets the Heat display priority. Now I need to call from other tables. All those are connected by
    // Couples table, so it would make more sense to prioritize that in the formatted view. HOWEVER.
    // If I do THAT, then I will be doing FOREACH COUPLE and that will repeat heats. Which is not intuitive.
    // Or at least not what we want to happen.
    // This way is a wall.
    //can I only call on one model?
    // this nested loop will not be efficient.*@
